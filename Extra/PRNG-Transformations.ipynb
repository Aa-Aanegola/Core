    "Let us assume that we have a PRNG that generates a single bit uniformly (either 0 or 1 with equal probability). Is it possible to create another PRNG using this one that returns a biased result? After tinkering with boolean algebra, I came to realize that it is beautifully simple.  \n",
    "Let us call our PRNG that returns a bit RB. What will (RB AND RB) return? We know that the AND operation returns 1 only when both its operands are 1. This means that this operation will return 1 25% of the time. Similarly if we do and OR operation, we will get 0 only 25% of the time."

    "As we can see above, the PRNGs returned 1 with the expected probability. Using the knowledge we gained above, can we generate 1 with any probability of our choice? After a little bit of thought, it is easy to see that this problem can be rephrased to make it easier to understand. Obtaining a 1 with probability x is equivalent to generating x equiprobable numbers. If the number so obtained is the xth number we return 1 otherwise we return 0. \n",
    "To generate x numbers, a simple thing to do would be to take x random bits and add them. However this constitutes a binomial distribution, and hence the probabilities so obtained will not be equal.  \n",
    "Another possibility that only works for powers of 2 is to generate a bitstring of length log<sub>2</sub>(x) and convert it back to decimal. This will give us a uniformly distributed random variable over the range (0, x-1).  \n",
    "For a number that isn't a power of 2, we can simply take the next greatest power of 2 and neglect the values that exceed x. This however is wasteful, and the runtime will be unbounded because it is possible to get an infinite sequence of numbers greater than the desired number. We also waste all the bits that we neglect which in the worst case can be half the bits we generate. To get past this hurdle, and generate uniformly distributed numbers we do the following :  \n",
    "- Let n be the upper bound on the number ie we want to generate numbers that lie in [0, n-1]\n",
    "- Let N be some large number such that the computer can represent 2N without any loss of data\n",

    "- Let r = 0 and m = 1 (these two variables)\n",
