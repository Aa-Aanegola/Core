    "# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Why is used?\n",
    "It is used for finding the shortest path and distance between all vertices in a graph. It can be used for finding negative cycles too.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## How it works?\n",
    "The shortest path between any 2 vertices are found in several incremental step. Each step finds the shortest path upto that point with that vertex as intermediate node. \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Proof\n",
    "**Claim:** Each step of algorithm finds shortest paths up to that point with that vertex as intermediate node.  \n",
    "***Base Case:*** For k = 1,  \n",
    "distance(i,j) = min.(distance(i,j), distance(i,1) + distance(i,j))  \n",
    "The algorithm holds because initially the pairs having edge will have distance equal to that of weight and the others will have infinity or 0 for i = j  \n",
    "distance(i,j) will remain the same if there exists an edge, else  if there exists such edges i to 1 and j to 1, it will change to distance(i,1) + distance(1,j) as initially distance was infinity  \n",
    "***Induction Step:*** Assume algorithm holds for k < p - 1  \n",
    "**To show:** It holds for k = p  \n",
    "***Case 1:*** distance(i,j) = min.(distance(i,j), distance(i,p) + distance(p,j)) = distance(i,j)  \n",
    "The distance remains unchanged and since the distance was calculated in a previous step for which the algorithm holds as per the assumption, the algorithm holds for k = p  \n",
    "***Case 2:*** distance(i,j) = min.(distance(i,j), distance(i,p) + distance(p,j)) = distance(i,p) + distance(p,j)  \n",
    "The distance changes and since the distances distance(i,p) and  distance(p,j) were calculated in a previous step, this means that the sum of the distances is less than the distance which were calculated in the previous steps without having k=p as an intermediate node. Hence this is the shortest path up to this step with vertex k=p as intermediate node.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "Consider a graph of E edges and V vertices.\n",
    "### Time complexity\n",
    "As evident from the 3 loops, time complexity is obviously $O(V^3)$\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Space complexity\n",
    "For each vertex, the vertex which it came from, and the distance to the other vertices are stored. Hence space complexity is $O(V^2)$"
